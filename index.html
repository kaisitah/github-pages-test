                For the first time I started a blog for which I'm writing the HTML and CSS code myself!
            </p>
            <p>
                I am self-studying the use of web development tools such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I use several web resources 
                such as <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org">Khan Academy</a> courses, <a href="https://code.org/learn">Hour of Code</a> challenges, 
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org">Mozilla Developer Network</a>, and more, for my studies.
            </p>
            <p>
                In <em>Khan Academy</em>, I started with the course "Intro to HTML/CSS: Making webpages". I have learned the basics of HTML and CSS styling. 
                My projects include simple webpages such as travel page, recipe book and now this blog. There is still a lot to learn about styling the sites 
                so they are not in their prettiest shape yet :-D.

            <p>
               After a day off, refilling my energy in the nature, I got back to learning to code. Today I explored a few learning platforms or materials 
               in JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="https://learnprogramming.online/">LearnProgramming.online</a> is a great platform to learn the basics of JavaScript. 
                It presents the key concepts in a consice and precise way, along with matching exercises to practice my new skills. 
                I learned to define and call functions!
            </p>
            <p>
                I also had fun with playing games that test your understanding of code. You may want to check <a href="http://www.toxicode.fr/learn">these Toxicode games</a> out, too! :-)

            <h2 id="post3">Going Live: Publishing my blog on GitHub Pages</h2>
            <p class="post-time">Posted on Sunday August 28, 2022</p>
            <p>
                I needed to have a break in my programming exercises because of getting ill and starting at a new job. 
                Luckily my new job is related to programming, so I didn't forget everything I had learned before the break!
            </p>
            <p>
               Finally I had time to try something really exciting: publish a webpage I had created within Khan Academy as a public page on GitHub Pages! 
               It was not the first index.html file I ever created but maybe the third one or so. I copy-pasted the source code of my learning blog webpage from Khan Academy.
               While I was at it, I decided to add some elements to the head of the site as well as add some clarity to my code with indentation. 
            </p>
            <p>
               I must say that the work I did with indenting the code really paid off: Now it's much easier to keep writing the blog and polish the style of the website.
               Another note about structure. The usage of <div> element is still a bit blurry for me, but I came up with one clear way of using it: 
               I added some structure to my blog by defining each of the posts as a separate <em>"content division element"</em>.
            </p>
