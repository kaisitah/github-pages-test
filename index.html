        <p>For the first time I started a blog for which I'm writing the HTML and CSS code myself!<br>
        <br>
        I am self-studying the use of web development tools such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I use several web resources 
        such as <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org">Khan Academy</a> courses, <a href="https://code.org/learn">Hour of Code</a> challenges, 
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org">Mozilla Developer Network</a>, and more, for my studies.<br>
        <br>
        In Khan Academy, I started with the course "Intro to HTML/CSS: Making webpages". I have learned the basics of HTML and CSS styling. 
        My projects include simple webpages such as travel page, recipe book and now this blog. There is still a lot to learn about styling the sites 
        so they are not in their prettiest shape yet :-D.

        <p>After a day off, refilling my energy in the nature, I got back to learning to code. Today I explored a few learning platforms or materials 
        in JavaScript.<br> 
        <br> 
        <a href="https://learnprogramming.online/">LearnProgramming.online</a> is a great platform to learn the basics of JavaScript. 
        It presents the key concepts in a consice and precise way, along with matching exercises to practice my new skills. 
        I learned to define and call functions!<br> 
        <br>
        I also had fun with playing games that test your understanding of code. You may want to check <a href="http://www.toxicode.fr/learn">these</a> out, too! :-)
